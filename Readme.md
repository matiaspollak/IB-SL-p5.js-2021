# P5js Starter Project for ML5
Template for trying out some machine learning with P5js!

This is following along with Daniel Shiffman's video at https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/158-shape-classifier.html , but the first step (generating shapes) has already been done - there are 300 images each of circles, triangles, and squares in the "data" folder, ready to train! They were generated with processing, just as he does in his video, though I made more images and rotated the squares and triangles more than he did.

You need to run `npm install` or use VS Code to run the task `npm:install` from the Terminal menu in order to get p5 and its type settings installed. Make sure you have the Live Server extension installed in VS Code to run a local server for debugging!

ML5 is imported in the HTML file using a CDN address, as it seems to have issues on npm right now.
